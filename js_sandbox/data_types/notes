data types

Primative data types: Stored directly in stack memory as literal value (not a reference)

- String, Number, Boolean, Null, Undefined, Symbols (ES6)

Reference data types:

- Arrays, Object literal, functions, dates, anything else

Dynamically typed:

The types are associated with their values, not the variables spaces themselves. 

Java (Static types)

int (<- type is here) x = 1;

vs 

Javascript (Dynamically typed)

x = (type is here ->) 1;

Typescript is a superset of JS that allows for static typing.
